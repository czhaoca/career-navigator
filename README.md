## Objective
To develop an AI-based tool, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), to guide CPA candidates in crafting comprehensive and compliant PERT job experience reports, ensuring they meet the professional standards and competency requirements set by the CPA regulatory body.

## Background
The CPA designation requires candidates to demonstrate practical experience in specific competency areas. Writing these experience reports can be challenging due to the nuances in demonstrating specific skills and responsibilities. This tool aims to simplify this process using advanced AI.

## Project Scope
1. Understanding CPA Requirements:
Detailed analysis of CPA competency requirements.
Integrating guidelines and examples provided by CPA bodies into the LLM.
2. LLM Integration:
Customizing an LLM to understand and process accounting and finance-related terminologies.
Training the model to recognize and suggest improvements in job descriptions, focusing on key competencies and technical skills.
3. User Interface Development:
Designing an intuitive interface where candidates can input their job descriptions and tasks.
Providing a question-and-answer format where the LLM asks probing questions to elicit more detailed responses relevant to CPA competencies.
4. Feedback and Enhancement Mechanism:
Incorporating a feedback loop where the LLM suggests enhancements on clarity, relevance, and specificity regarding CPA competency demonstration.
Including real-time tips and advice on how to structure reports effectively.

## Methodology
1. Data Collection & Training:
- Gathering a range of sample PERT reports and related documents.
- Training the LLM on these documents while emphasizing ethical guidelines and confidentiality.

2. Algorithm Development:
- Developing algorithms for the LLM to identify, categorize, and suggest improvements in PERT reports.

3. Beta Testing & Iterations:
- Initial testing with a group of CPA candidates.
- Iterative improvements based on feedback.

## Expected Outcomes
- Enhanced Report Quality: Improvement in the clarity, relevance, and demonstration of competencies in PERT reports.
- Time Efficiency: Reduced time and effort for CPA candidates in preparing their reports.
- Compliance and Professionalism: Higher adherence to CPA reporting standards and professional expectations.

## Project Timeline
- Research and Development: 9+ Sprints
- Pilot Testing: 3 Sprints
- Launch and Roll-out: 3 Sprints

## Evaluation
- Feedback from CPA candidates and potential audit of report acceptances.
- Surveys to measure satisfaction and effectiveness.

## Future Considerations
- Continuous updating of the LLM database to include new regulations, standards, and competency requirements.
- Expanding the toolâ€™s capabilities to offer personalized career advice and learning resources for CPAs.
