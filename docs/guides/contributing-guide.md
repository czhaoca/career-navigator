## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/career-navigator.git
cd career-navigator
```

3. Add the upstream repository:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-org/career-navigator.git
```

4. Set up your development environment following the [Development Setup Guide](./development-setup.md)

### Finding Something to Work On

- Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/your-org/career-navigator/issues) for open issues
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Review the [Project Roadmap](../features/README.md#upcoming-features)
- Propose new features by creating an issue first

## Development Process

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
# Update your main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# Or for bugs: git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the coding standards
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Type checking
npm run typecheck
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
# Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>

# Examples:
git commit -m "feat(auth): add two-factor authentication"
git commit -m "fix(api): resolve database connection timeout"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
git commit -m "refactor(frontend): simplify state management"
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### 5. Push Your Changes

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the user's career progression score
 * @param experiences - Array of user experiences
 * @returns Career progression score (0-100)
 */
export function calculateCareerScore(experiences: Experience[]): number {
  // Implementation
}
```

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow single responsibility principle
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use proper TypeScript types for props

```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  onClick: () => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  disabled?: boolean;
}

export function Button({ onClick, children, variant = 'primary', disabled = false }: ButtonProps) {
  // Component implementation
}
```

### Database

- Follow naming conventions (snake_case for tables/columns)
- Always include migrations for schema changes
- Add appropriate indexes for performance
- Document complex queries

### API Design

- Follow RESTful principles
- Use consistent error responses
- Version APIs when making breaking changes
- Document all endpoints

## Pull Request Process
