## Rate Limiting

- Standard endpoints: 100 requests per minute
- Bulk operations: 20 requests per minute
- AI operations (skill extraction): 30 requests per minute

## Best Practices

1. **Use Bulk Operations**: When creating or updating multiple experiences, use the bulk endpoints to reduce API calls.

2. **Filter Appropriately**: Use query parameters to filter results and reduce response size.

3. **Extract Skills Wisely**: Skill extraction uses AI and may be rate-limited. Cache results when possible.

4. **Templates for Consistency**: Use templates when creating similar experiences to maintain consistency.

5. **Error Handling**: Always handle potential errors, especially for bulk operations where partial failures are possible.
