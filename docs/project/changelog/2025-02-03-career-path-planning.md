## Changes Made

### Explicit Changes Requested
1. **Career Path Planning Feature Implementation**
   - Created comprehensive career path planning system
   - Implemented skills gap analysis
   - Built learning recommendations engine
   - Added goal tracking functionality

### Database Changes
1. **Created new database tables**:
   - `pf_career_nodes` - Career roles and positions
   - `pf_career_transitions` - Possible career progressions
   - `pf_user_career_goals` - User career objectives
   - `pf_user_skills_progress` - Skills development tracking
   - `pf_learning_resources` - Curated learning materials
   - `pf_goal_milestones` - Goal achievement tracking
   - `pf_learning_activities` - Learning activity logs

2. **Added seed data**:
   - Software engineering career paths (junior to staff/manager)
   - Data science career paths
   - Product management career paths
   - Career transitions with difficulty scores
   - Sample learning resources

### Backend Implementation
1. **Created service layer**:
   - `careerPathService.js` - Core career path logic and visualization
   - `skillsGapService.js` - Skills gap analysis and assessment
   - `learningService.js` - Learning recommendations and progress tracking

2. **Created controller**:
   - `careerPathController.js` - REST API endpoints for all features

3. **Created routes**:
   - `careerPathRoutes.js` - Route definitions with validation

4. **Updated dependency injection**:
   - Modified `container.js` to register new services and controller
   - Added proper dependency wiring

5. **Updated main app**:
   - Added career path routes to `app.js`

### API Endpoints Created
1. **Career Path Endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/career-paths/search` - Search career roles
   - `GET /api/career-paths/:nodeId` - Get role details
   - `GET /api/career-paths/:nodeId/transitions` - Get career transitions
   - `POST /api/career-paths/visualize` - Generate path visualization

2. **Skills Gap Analysis**:
   - `GET /api/skills-gap/:currentRole/:targetRole` - Analyze skills gap
   - `GET /api/skills-gap/user/:userId` - User's skills gaps
   - `POST /api/skills-gap/assessment` - Submit skills assessment

3. **Learning Endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/learning/recommendations/:skillId` - Get learning resources
   - `GET /api/learning/user/:userId/plan` - Personalized learning plan
   - `POST /api/learning/progress` - Log learning activity

4. **Goal Management**:
   - `GET /api/goals/user/:userId` - Get user goals
   - `POST /api/goals` - Create career goal
   - `PUT /api/goals/:goalId` - Update goal
   - `GET /api/goals/:goalId/milestones` - Get goal milestones

### Documentation
1. **Created API documentation**: `docs/api/career-path-endpoints.md`
2. **Created feature documentation**: `docs/features/career-path-planning.md`

### Additional Changes
1. **Fixed DOCX export**: Installed missing `docx` package for resume generation
2. **Updated table prefix**: Changed from `cn_` to `pf_` prefix throughout codebase
3. **Updated CLAUDE.md**: Corrected table prefix documentation

## Technical Details

### Architecture Decisions
- Used graph-based approach for career path visualization
- Implemented BFS algorithm for finding multiple career paths
- Created skill-based progression tracking with levels (1-5)
- Built flexible learning resource recommendation system

### Key Features
1. **Career Path Visualization**:
   - Multi-path discovery between roles
   - Path scoring based on difficulty and duration
   - Transition success rates

2. **Skills Gap Analysis**:
   - Required vs preferred skills differentiation
   - Transferable skills identification
   - Time estimation for transitions

3. **Learning Recommendations**:
   - Resource filtering by cost, type, difficulty
   - Value scoring for resources
   - Weekly schedule generation

4. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Automated skill level updates
   - Achievement system for milestones
   - Goal progress calculation

### Security Considerations
- All endpoints require JWT authentication
- User data isolation for goals and progress
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting applied

## Decisions and Assumptions
1. Used 20 hours of learning = 1 skill level as baseline
2. Implemented 3-month average per required skill for transition estimates
3. Created achievement system to encourage consistent learning
4. Limited career path depth to 5 transitions for performance

## Next Steps
Based on the roadmap, the next features to implement are:
1. Career path visualization UI components
2. Professional networking features
3. Job search integration
4. Learning & development tracking UI
