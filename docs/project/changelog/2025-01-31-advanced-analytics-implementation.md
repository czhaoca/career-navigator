- Score explanations
- Rate limiting information
- Best practices guide

### 14. Progress Updates
- Updated ROADMAP.md to mark Phase 1.3 as completed
- All four items in Phase 1.3 marked as done:
  - Skills progression tracking ✅
  - Career trajectory visualization ✅
  - Achievement quantification tools ✅
  - Experience impact scoring ✅

## Technical Decisions

1. **Multi-Scoring System**: Implemented five different scoring dimensions (velocity, diversity, leadership, technical depth, industry expertise) for comprehensive career assessment.

2. **AI-Powered Extraction**: Used OpenAI for intelligent metric extraction with pattern-matching fallback to ensure functionality without API key.

3. **Caching Strategy**: Analytics summaries are cached daily to balance freshness with performance.

4. **Proficiency Levels**: Used 5-level system (Beginner to Expert) based on usage duration and evidence count.

5. **Career Velocity**: Calculated based on role progression speed and level changes over time.

## Architecture Highlights

1. **Service Layer Pattern**: Analytics logic separated into service layer for reusability
2. **Repository Pattern**: Database operations abstracted for maintainability
3. **Dependency Injection**: Services properly injected through container
4. **Component Composition**: Reusable UI components for analytics visualization
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript types for all analytics data structures

## Next Steps

Based on the roadmap, the next phase is **1.4: Resume Generation**, which includes:
- Create resume builder interface
- Add multiple resume templates
- Implement ATS optimization
- Add export to PDF/DOCX
