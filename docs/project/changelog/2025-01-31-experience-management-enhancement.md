# Changelog Entry - January 31, 2025

## Conversation Summary

User requested to "work on next item on roadmap", continuing from Phase 1.1 completion to Phase 1.2: Experience Management Enhancement.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Experience Routes (`backend/src/api/routes/experienceRoutes.js`)
- Added `/stats` endpoint for experience statistics
- Added `/templates` endpoint for experience templates
- Added `/bulk` POST endpoint for bulk creation
- Added `/bulk` PUT endpoint for bulk updates
- Added `/:id/duplicate` endpoint for duplicating experiences
- Added `/:id/extract-skills` endpoint for AI skill extraction
- Fixed route ordering to avoid conflicts (stats and templates before /:id)

### 2. Implemented Controller Methods (`backend/src/api/controllers/experienceController.js`)
- `getExperienceStats()` - Retrieves user experience statistics
- `bulkCreateExperiences()` - Creates multiple experiences with validation
- `bulkUpdateExperiences()` - Updates multiple experiences with validation
- `duplicateExperience()` - Duplicates an experience with modifications
- `extractSkills()` - Extracts skills using AI or keyword matching
- `getExperienceTemplates()` - Returns pre-defined experience templates

### 3. Enhanced Experience Service (`backend/src/services/experienceService.js`)
- Added `bulkCreateExperiences()` with enrichment and audit logging
- Added `bulkUpdateExperiences()` with batch processing
- Added `duplicateExperience()` with modification support
- Added `extractSkills()` with regeneration option
- Implemented `extractSkillsWithAI()` using OpenAI GPT for intelligent skill extraction
- Added `extractSkillsWithKeywords()` as fallback method
- Added `normalizeSkillCategory()` for skill categorization
- Added `getExperienceTemplates()` with category filtering
- Enhanced skill categories to include more technologies

### 4. OpenAI Integration for Skill Extraction
- Integrated OpenAI service into ExperienceService constructor
- Updated dependency injection container to provide OpenAI service
- Created intelligent prompts for skill extraction with confidence scoring
- Implemented JSON response parsing with validation
- Added fallback to keyword extraction when OpenAI unavailable

### 5. Frontend Updates
- Enhanced experience types (`frontend/src/types/experience.ts`):
  - Added `ExperienceTemplate` interface
  - Added `ExtractedSkill` interface with confidence scores
  - Added `BulkExperienceUpdate` interface
- Updated experience service (`frontend/src/services/experienceService.ts`):
  - Added `bulkCreateExperiences()` method
  - Added `bulkUpdateExperiences()` method
  - Added `duplicateExperience()` method
  - Added `extractSkills()` method
  - Added `getTemplates()` method

### 6. Integration Tests (`backend/tests/integration/experienceEnhancement.test.js`)
- Created comprehensive test suite for all new endpoints
- Tests for stats, templates, bulk operations, duplication, and skill extraction
- Validation testing for bulk operations
- Error handling tests

### 7. API Documentation (`docs/api/experience-endpoints.md`)
- Complete documentation for all 11 experience endpoints
- Request/response examples for each endpoint
- Error response documentation
- Rate limiting information
- Best practices section

### 8. Progress Updates
- Updated ROADMAP.md to mark Phase 1.2 progress
- Marked CRUD operations as completed
- Marked AI-powered skill extraction as completed
- Marked experience templates as completed
- LinkedIn/Resume import remains pending for future implementation

## Technical Decisions

1. **Route Ordering**: Placed static routes (/stats, /templates) before dynamic routes (/:id) to avoid routing conflicts.

2. **AI Fallback**: Implemented keyword-based skill extraction as fallback when OpenAI is unavailable, ensuring functionality without API key.

3. **Bulk Operations**: Designed to process items individually with error collection, allowing partial success rather than all-or-nothing.

4. **Skill Confidence**: Added confidence scores (0-1) to extracted skills to indicate extraction reliability.

5. **Template Structure**: Created flexible template system with categories, suggested skills, and pre-filled descriptions.

## Next Steps

Based on the roadmap, the next item would be:
- Phase 1.3: Advanced Experience Analytics (skills progression tracking, career trajectory visualization)
- Or complete the remaining item in 1.2: Add bulk import from LinkedIn/Resume

## Commit Reference

This work will be committed with message: "feat: Implement enhanced experience management with AI skill extraction"
