# Changelog Entry: Remove RENAME_INSTRUCTIONS.md

**Date**: 2025-01-28
**Time**: Morning session (following repository rename)

## User Request Summary
Remove RENAME_INSTRUCTIONS.md after final inspection that all cn_ prefix changed

## Changes Made

### Explicit Changes
1. **File Removal**: Removed `/work/pathfinder/RENAME_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### Implicit Changes
1. **Codebase Inspection**: Searched entire codebase for `cn_` prefixes
2. **Verification**: Confirmed only intentional `cn_` prefixes remain (database table prefixes kept for backward compatibility)

## Verification Results
- Found `cn_` references in only 2 files:
  - `CLAUDE.md`: Documents that table prefixes use `cn_` for shared database coexistence
  - `RENAME_INSTRUCTIONS.md`: Listed `cn_` prefixes as intentionally unchanged for backward compatibility

## Decisions and Assumptions
- Database table prefixes (`cn_`) were intentionally preserved during the rename process
- The RENAME_INSTRUCTIONS.md file served its purpose and is no longer needed
- All other references to "career-navigator" have been successfully changed to "pathfinder"

## Technical Details
- Used grep to search for any remaining `cn_` prefixes
- Verified that keeping `cn_` prefixes is documented as intentional for backward compatibility
