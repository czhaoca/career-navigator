# Changelog Entry: CPA PERT Module Implementation

**Date**: 2025-01-28  
**Time**: Morning session (following documentation requirements update)

## User Request Summary
Work on next item on roadmap - CPA PERT Module Implementation (Week 3-6 priority)

## Changes Made

### Explicit Changes
1. **Database Schema Creation**:
   - Created `create-cpa-pert-tables.js` migration file with complete CPA PERT schema
   - Implemented 6 core tables: competencies, mappings, responses, assessments, compliance, and history
   - Added proper indexes, constraints, and triggers for data integrity

2. **Seed Data Update**:
   - Updated `seed-cpa-competencies.js` with EVR-specific competency framework
   - Added 15 core competencies across Technical and Enabling categories
   - Included Level 1/2 criteria, guiding questions, and EVR relevance ratings

3. **Documentation Update**:
   - Updated `cpa-pert-relationships.md` to reflect new schema structure
   - Changed table prefixes from CN_ to PF_ for consistency
   - Added detailed EVR compliance requirements and integration points

### Implicit Changes
1. **Migration Cleanup**:
   - Deleted existing `create-cpa-pert-schema.js` as requested (no deployments yet)
   - Created fresh migration following current patterns

2. **Service Layer Review**:
   - Reviewed existing `cpaPertService.js` - already implements required functionality
   - Service follows dependency injection pattern with comprehensive methods

3. **Schema Improvements**:
   - Added `pf_cpa_pert_history` table for version tracking
   - Enhanced compliance checks with 30-month and 12-month rule tracking
   - Implemented proper NUMBER(1) fields instead of CHAR(1) for booleans

## Technical Details
- Migration uses Oracle-specific SQL with proper data types
- Seed data provides comprehensive competency framework for EVR route
- Schema enforces 5000 character limit on PERT responses
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate mappings and assessments
- Triggers automatically update timestamps

## Decisions and Assumptions
- Used pf_ prefix for all tables (project standard)
- Competency IDs are short codes (e.g., 'FR1', 'MA2') for easier reference
- EVR relevance categorized as HIGH/MEDIUM for prioritization
- History table tracks all PERT response versions for audit trail
- Service layer already exists and doesn't need recreation

## Next Steps from Roadmap
Backend Implementation:
- ✅ Create database schema for CPA PERT data
- ⏳ Implement competency mapping service (exists, may need enhancement)
- ⏳ Build PERT response generation engine (exists in service)
- ⏳ Add EVR compliance validation (exists in service)
- ⏳ Create batch processing capabilities (exists in service)
