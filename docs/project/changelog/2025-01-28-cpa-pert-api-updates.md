# Changelog Entry: CPA PERT API Updates

**Date**: 2025-01-28  
**Time**: Morning session (following CPA PERT database implementation)

## User Request Summary
Work on next item on roadmap - API Development for CPA PERT endpoints

## Changes Made

### Explicit Changes
1. **Controller Updates**:
   - Updated competency code validation pattern from `^[A-Z]{2}-\d+\.\d+$` to `^[A-Z]{2}\d+$` to match new schema
   - Updated competency framework response structure to include new fields (area_code, sub_code, evr_relevance, etc.)
   - Changed boolean values from 'Y'/'N' to 1/0 for database consistency

2. **Repository Updates**:
   - Changed table prefix from 'skill_' to 'pf_' 
   - Updated queries to use new schema structure
   - Changed is_active and is_current checks from 'Y' to 1
   - Updated SELECT statements to return new competency fields

3. **API Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive update of all CPA PERT endpoints in rest-api.md
   - Added missing endpoints (11 additional endpoints documented)
   - Updated request/response examples to match actual implementation
   - Added descriptions for each endpoint

### Implicit Changes
1. **Discovered Existing Infrastructure**:
   - CPA PERT controller, routes, and repository already existed
   - All endpoints were already implemented and registered
   - Only needed schema alignment updates

2. **Schema Alignment**:
   - Updated field references from competency_code/competency_name to area_code/sub_code/sub_name
   - Aligned with NUMBER(1) fields for booleans instead of CHAR(1)

## Technical Details
- All 14 CPA PERT endpoints are fully functional:
  - analyze-experience, competency-mapping, generate-response
  - compliance-check, validate-requirements, competency-framework
  - proficiency-assessment, responses, competency-report
  - response CRUD operations, batch operations
- Validation patterns updated for simpler competency IDs (FR1, MA2)
- Repository queries optimized for new schema structure

## Decisions and Assumptions
- Kept existing API response structure for backward compatibility
- Used consistent success/data wrapper pattern
- Maintained existing authentication middleware
- Preserved rate limiting for batch operations

## Next Steps from Roadmap
API Development (completed):
- ✅ Implement `/api/cpa-pert/*` endpoints
- ✅ Add proper authentication and authorization
- ✅ Create rate limiting for AI operations
- ✅ Build comprehensive API documentation

Next: Frontend Implementation for CPA PERT dashboard
