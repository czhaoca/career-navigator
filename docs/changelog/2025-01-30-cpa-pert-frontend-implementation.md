# CPA PERT Frontend Implementation

## Date: January 30, 2025

## Summary
Implemented CPA PERT frontend components, service layer, and hooks to integrate with the backend API. Updated TypeScript types to match the actual backend data structures and created fully functional React components for the CPA PERT module.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated TypeScript Types (`/frontend/src/types/cpaPert.ts`)
- Aligned types with actual backend API response structures
- Added proper type definitions for all CPA PERT entities:
  - `CPACompetency` - Master competency definition
  - `CompetencyMapping` - Experience to competency mappings
  - `PertResponse` - PERT response with STAR method fields
  - `ProficiencyAssessment` - User proficiency tracking
  - `ComplianceCheck` and `ComplianceResult` - EVR compliance validation
  - `CompetencyReport` - Comprehensive user progress report
- Added request/response types for API calls

### 2. Updated CPA PERT Service (`/frontend/src/services/cpaPertService.ts`)
- Updated all methods to match the backend API endpoints
- Fixed parameter types and return types
- Added proper error handling
- Methods implemented:
  - `analyzeExperience()` - Analyze experience for competency mappings
  - `generateResponse()` - Generate PERT response
  - `getComplianceCheck()` - Check EVR compliance status
  - `validateRequirements()` - Validate and update EVR requirements
  - `getCompetencyReport()` - Get comprehensive competency report
  - Batch operations for analyzing multiple experiences

### 3. Enhanced CPA PERT Hook (`/frontend/src/hooks/useCPAPert.ts`)
- Updated to use the new service methods
- Added comprehensive error handling with toast notifications
- Added loading states and error states
- Auto-loads competency framework on mount
- Provides all necessary methods for CPA PERT functionality

### 4. Updated Frontend Components

#### CompetencyMapper Component
- Complete rewrite to work with actual API
- Shows competency mappings with relevance scores
- Visual indicators for match quality (90%+, 80%+, 70%+)
- Summary statistics (total competencies, strong matches, average relevance)
- Scrollable list of mapped competencies with evidence
- Click-through to generate PERT responses

#### PertResponseEditor Component
- Refactored to support PERT response generation and editing
- STAR method structured editor with character limits:
  - Situation (800 chars)
  - Task (600 chars)
  - Action (2000 chars)
  - Result (1000 chars)
- Full text editor with syntax highlighting
- Character count tracking with visual warnings
- Proficiency level selection (0, 1, 2)
- Save, copy, and download functionality

#### ComplianceMonitor Component
- Real-time EVR compliance checking
- Visual progress bars for requirements
- Requirements checklist with status indicators
- Recommendations based on current progress
- Statistics grid showing competency levels
- Auto-refreshes compliance status

#### ProgressTracker Component
- Comprehensive competency progress visualization
- Three view modes:
  - Overview: All competencies sorted by level
  - By Category: Grouped by Technical/Enabling
  - Development Plan: Immediate, short-term, and long-term actions
- Summary cards for Level 2, Level 1, Level 0, and total responses
- Click-through navigation to competency details

## Implementation Details

### Key Features
1. **Real-time Validation**: All components validate data in real-time
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
3. **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators for async operations
4. **Responsive Design**: All components are mobile-friendly
5. **Dark Mode Support**: Proper color schemes for dark mode
6. **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

### Integration Points
- Uses existing UI components from shadcn/ui
- Integrates with existing authentication via hooks
- Compatible with existing experience management system
- Uses consistent styling with the rest of the application

## Next Steps
The next phase involves creating the CPA PERT UI pages that will use these components:
1. CPA PERT Dashboard page
2. Competency Mapping page
3. PERT Report Writer page
4. Compliance Tracker page
5. PERT Report History page

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test competency analysis with various experience types
2. Verify PERT response generation meets character limits
3. Test compliance checking with different competency combinations
4. Verify batch operations handle errors gracefully
5. Test component interactions and state management

## Notes
- All components are production-ready
- API integration has been tested with the backend structure
- Components follow React best practices and TypeScript strict mode
- Performance optimized with proper memoization and lazy loading
