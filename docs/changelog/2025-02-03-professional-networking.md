## Technical Details

### Architecture Decisions

- Built recurring reminder system with multiple patterns
- Designed AI recommendation engine with relevance scoring

### Key Features
1. **Contact Management**:
   - Comprehensive contact profiles
   - Relationship strength tracking
   - Tag-based categorization
   - Import/export capabilities

2. **Interaction Tracking**:
   - Multiple interaction types
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Value exchange tracking
   - Meeting notes with action items

3. **Smart Reminders**:
   - Follow-up reminders
   - Recurring patterns

   - Overdue handling

4. **AI Recommendations**:

   - Networking insights

### Security Considerations
- All endpoints require JWT authentication
- Contact data isolation per user
- Audit logging for all operations
- No cross-user data access

## Decisions and Assumptions
1. Relationship strength uses 1-5 scale (not 1-10 as in design doc)
2. Meeting notes are linked to interactions, not separate entities
3. Implemented basic AI recommendations (full AI integration pending)
4. Message templates stored in database for flexibility

## Next Steps
Based on the roadmap, the next features to implement are:
1. Frontend components for professional networking
2. Job Search Integration (Phase 2.3)
3. Learning & Development features (Phase 2.4)
4. Multi-language support (Phase 3.1)
