AI: For a Product Manager role, here's a structured approach tailored 
to your background:

🎯 Structure (2-3 minutes):
1. Current Role (30 sec): "I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer..."
2. Relevant Experience (60 sec): Highlight cross-functional work

4. Value Proposition (30 sec): What unique value you bring

📝 Your Tailored Example:
"I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at Tech Corp, where I've 
spent 4 years building consumer-facing products that serve over 1M users. 
While I love the technical challenges, I've found myself increasingly 
drawn to the strategic decisions behind what we build...
