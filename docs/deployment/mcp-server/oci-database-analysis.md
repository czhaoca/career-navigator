## Implementation Guide

### Database Architecture Design

**Recommended Configuration:**
```
Database 1: Primary Application Database (20GB)
├── experiences_detailed (Level 1) - ~60% storage
├── profile_summaries (Level 2) - ~25% storage
├── skills_mapping - ~10% storage
└── career_paths - ~5% storage

Database 2: MCP Context & Performance (20GB)
├── quick_summaries (Level 3) - ~30% storage
├── user_sessions - ~20% storage
├── mcp_context_cache - ~25% storage
├── audit_logs - ~15% storage
└── role_profiles - ~10% storage
```

### Connection Pool Configuration

**Recommended Settings:**
```javascript
// Database Connection Pool Configuration
const poolConfig = {
  database1: {
    max: 15,        // Reserve 5 for admin/maintenance
    min: 2,
    idle: 10000,
    acquire: 60000,
    evict: 1000
  },
  database2: {
    max: 15,        // Reserve 5 for admin/maintenance  
    min: 2,
    idle: 10000,
    acquire: 60000,
    evict: 1000
  }
};
```

### Security Configuration

**Encryption Setup:**
```sql
-- Enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
-- TDE is enabled by default in Autonomous Database
-- Verify encryption status
SELECT * FROM V$ENCRYPTION_WALLET;

-- Create encrypted tablespace for sensitive data
CREATE TABLESPACE career_data_secure
DATAFILE SIZE 1G
ENCRYPTION USING 'AES256'
DEFAULT STORAGE(ENCRYPT);
```

**Row-Level Security:**
```sql
-- Implement row-level security for multi-tenant isolation
CREATE POLICY user_data_policy ON experiences_detailed
FOR ALL TO career_app_role
USING (user_id = SYS_CONTEXT('career_app_ctx', 'current_user_id'));

ALTER TABLE experiences_detailed ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Performance Optimization

**Index Strategy:**
```sql
-- Create optimized indexes for MCP queries
CREATE INDEX idx_quick_summaries_user_lookup 
ON quick_summaries (user_id, last_updated);

-- JSON field indexes for skills queries
CREATE INDEX idx_experiences_skills_gin 
ON experiences_detailed (JSON_VALUE(extracted_skills, '$[*].name'));

-- Temporal queries for career progression
CREATE INDEX idx_experiences_temporal 
ON experiences_detailed (user_id, start_date, end_date);
```

**Query Optimization:**
```sql
-- Optimize Level 3 quick context queries (< 10ms target)
SELECT summary_data, key_skills, career_goals
FROM quick_summaries 
WHERE user_id = :user_id 
AND status = 'active';

-- Efficient aggregation for Level 2 profiles  
SELECT JSON_OBJECT(
  'core_strengths', core_strengths,
  'career_progression', career_progression,
  'industry_experience', industry_experience
) as profile_data
FROM profile_summaries
WHERE user_id = :user_id;
```

### Data Management Strategy

**Compression and Archiving:**
```sql
-- Enable advanced compression for large JSON fields
ALTER TABLE experiences_detailed 
MODIFY (description COMPRESS FOR OLTP);

-- Partition strategy for temporal data
ALTER TABLE experiences_detailed 
PARTITION BY RANGE (created_date) 
INTERVAL (NUMTOYMINTERVAL(1,'YEAR'))
(PARTITION p_initial VALUES LESS THAN (DATE '2024-01-01'));
```

**Monitoring Queries:**
```sql
-- Storage utilization monitoring
SELECT 
  tablespace_name,
  ROUND((bytes/1024/1024/1024),2) as gb_used,
  ROUND(((bytes/1024/1024/1024)/(20*1024))*100,2) as percent_used
FROM user_segments
WHERE tablespace_name IN ('DATA', 'career_data_secure');

-- Connection monitoring
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as active_sessions,
  AVG(seconds_in_wait) as avg_wait_time
FROM v$session 
WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'
AND username = 'CAREER_APP_USER';
```
