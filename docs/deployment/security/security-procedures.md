## Security Overview

### Security Architecture
Pathfinder implements defense-in-depth security with multiple layers:

- **Application Layer**: JWT authentication, rate limiting, input validation
- **Data Layer**: User-prefixed schema isolation, field-level encryption
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Docker containerization, network segmentation
- **Monitoring Layer**: Comprehensive audit logging, threat detection
- **Compliance Layer**: HIPAA-level standards, data retention policies

### Security Principles
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users access only necessary resources
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against failures
3. **Zero Trust**: Every request is authenticated and authorized
4. **Privacy by Design**: Data protection built into every feature
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and response
